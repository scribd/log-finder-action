# Log Finder

![Log Finder](https://github.com/scribd/log-finder-action/workflows/Log%20Finder/badge.svg)

GitHub Action for searching a string to find all contained log files.


If you have a build log file that looks something like this:

```
Please update to the latest Carthage version: 0.35.0. You currently are on 0.34.0
*** No Cartfile.resolved found, updating dependencies
*** Fetching SomeProject
*** Fetching OtherProject
*** Checking out AnotherProject at "v3.17.3"
*** Checking out FinalProject at "1273cb428e0c9a43c1de964ef896c532ee67391e"
*** xcodebuild output can be found in /var/folders/wz/gfmnqb3x78sgz5vww3w2mrjh0000gn/T/carthage-xcodebuild.asdf.123.log
*** Building scheme "SomeProject-iOS" in AnotherProject.xcworkspace
*** Building scheme "SomeProject-watchOS" in AnotherProject.xcworkspace
*** Building scheme "OtherProject-watchOS" in FinalProject.xcodeproj\
*** Error, failed to build scheme. See error file: ./build-output/error.log for more info.
```

This action can parse the build log, and will return this:

```
/var/folders/wz/gfmnqb3x78sgz5vww3w2mrjh0000gn/T/carthage-xcodebuild.asdf.123.log
./build-output/error.log
```

This list can then easily be used with the [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.
